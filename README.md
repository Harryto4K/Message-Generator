# Message Generator 

This message generator is based on an horoscope 
==================


## Objective

The objective of this project was to code a message generator based on an horoscope that takes no arguments and returns a random message based on 3 types of data.

## Functionality

The 3 types of data are: 

  * Words
  * Time 
  * Message

### Words
The words variable is an array composed of words that describe the day or night you will have. 


### Time
The time is an array of two words that will stablish the time of the message (day or night). 


### Message 
The message is the last piece of data and combines the two pieces of data to form a message. 


* **_The final message is decided with a Math.random on the message variable._**
